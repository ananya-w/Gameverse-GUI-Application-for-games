# Gameverse: GUI Application for Games

## Project Overview

Gameverse is an interactive desktop application developed using Python and web technologies, designed to provide users with an engaging platform to play a variety of games. The application features six games, each incorporating advanced AI algorithms to enhance gameplay. This project not only offers entertainment but also showcases the practical application of theoretical AI concepts in real-world scenarios.

## Features

- **Tic-Tac-Toe:** Implemented using the A* search algorithm for optimal move selection.
- **Rat in a Maze:** Utilizes BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search) to navigate through the maze.
- **8 Puzzle Game:** Employs the A* algorithm to find the shortest solution to the puzzle.
- **Water Jug Problem:** Solved using DFS to explore possible solutions.
- **Traveling Salesman Problem:** Tackles the classic optimization problem using heuristic algorithms to find the shortest possible route.
- **Decision Tree:** A game or decision-based scenario where the Decision Tree algorithm is applied to guide the player's choices.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core programming language used to develop the application and implement AI algorithms.
- **Tkinter:** Python's standard GUI library used to create the application's user interface.
- **Web Technologies:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are integrated to enhance the application's visuals and user experience.
- **AI Algorithms:** A* for optimal pathfinding, BFS/DFS for search problems, heuristic algorithms for optimization, and Decision Trees for strategic decision-making.

## Project Structure
- **main.py:** The entry point of the application.
- **games/**: Contains the individual game modules and their respective AI implementations.
- **assets/**: Includes images, icons, and other static assets used in the GUI.
- **requirements.txt:** Lists all the Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Future Enhancements
- **Multiplayer Mode:** Add online multiplayer capabilities to some of the games.
- **More Games:** Expand the collection of games by incorporating additional AI-based games.
- **Leaderboard:** Implement a scoring system and leaderboard to track player progress and performance.

## Acknowledgements
- Inspired by classic games and the application of AI to create more challenging and engaging experiences.
